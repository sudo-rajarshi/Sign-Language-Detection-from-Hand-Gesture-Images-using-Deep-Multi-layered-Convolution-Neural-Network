# Sign-Language-Detection-from-Hand-Gesture-Images-using-Deep-Multi-layered-Convolution-Neural-Network

This is a multiclass classification of different static and dynamic hand gesture images like-
1. 0 to 9
2. A to Z
3. Aborad, Afraid, Bring, etc.

Using advanced image processing and deep learning algorithms the results of the classification are-
1. Training Accuracy = 99.72 %
2. Validation Accuracy = 99.96 %
3. Test Accuracy = 99.93 %

4. Sensitivity = 99.93 %
5. Specificity = 99.99 %
